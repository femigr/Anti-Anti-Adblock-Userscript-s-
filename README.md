# Anti-Anti-Adblock-Userscripts

Containing userscript to circumvent Anti-Adblock-features of the following webpages:

-sueddeutsche.de (because it keeps blocking me out even when I deactivate my AdBlocker, propably because of the privacy features of the browser) -> working (March 13, 2019)

-spiegel.de (same as sueddeutsche.de) -> working (March 13, 2019)

Can be used via plugins like Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey
